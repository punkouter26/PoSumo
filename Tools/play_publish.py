"""Upload a signed AAB to the Google Play Console via the Play Developer API v3.

WHY THIS EXISTS. There is no way to reach the Play Console from a headless
session: it is a browser product behind an interactive Google login. The
Developer API is the supported non-interactive route, and it authenticates with
a SERVICE ACCOUNT key rather than a human account -- which is also why this
script can never act "as punkouter27". It acts as a robot account that the human
account has granted release permission to. That grant is the one-time manual
step no script can do for you; see SETUP below.

SAFETY MODEL, because this is the one tool here that talks to the outside world:

  - The default track is `internal`, NOT production. Shipping to users is opt-in.
  - The default release status is `draft`. A draft is uploaded and visible in the
    console but is NOT rolled out to anybody until a human presses the button.
    Getting `completed` requires typing it.
  - `--dry-run` does the whole flow -- edit, upload, track write -- and then
    DELETES the edit instead of committing. Nothing an uncommitted edit does is
    visible to users, so this is a genuine rehearsal and not an approximation.
  - The current state of the target track is printed BEFORE the upload, so a
    versionCode collision is something you see rather than something you find
    out from an API error.

SETUP (one time, and it needs a human in a browser):

  1. Google Cloud console -> the project linked to your Play account ->
     IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts -> Create. No GCP roles are needed.
  2. On that service account, Keys -> Add key -> JSON. Download it.
  3. Play Console -> Users and permissions -> Invite new user -> paste the
     service account email -> grant "Release to production, exclude devices,
     and use Play App Signing" (or narrower) for the PoSumo app.
     The invite must be for the APP, and permission changes take a few minutes
     to propagate -- a 401 right after granting is usually just impatience.
  4. Put the JSON next to the keystore, which is already the project's
     convention for secrets that must stay out of the repo:
       C:/Users/punko/Downloads/PoSumo-Release/play-service-account.json

USAGE

  python Tools/play_publish.py --dry-run
  python Tools/play_publish.py --track internal --status completed
